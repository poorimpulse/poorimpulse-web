  "notes": "Thank you for trying out my new podcast.  This is an experiment to help me learn audio recording/editing, audiobook narration, and force me to work on short stories.  It's also a great excuse to play Fiasco with my friends and family.  This first episode was all about learning, and boy did I learn alot.  That's why the episode isn't perfect, but I appreciate you taking the time to listen, and know that future episodes will be vastly improved over this first one.  Let's consider this a beta, shall we?"
