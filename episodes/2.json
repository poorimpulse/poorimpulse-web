  "notes": "<p>This episode was a long time coming, but unfortunately it looks way too long to get it from game session to a script that was workable, and it's not complete.  Because it was going to be so long, I had to chop this episode into two parts.  Hopefully you enjoy!</p><p>If you would like to set up a recurring donation, please visit <a href=\"http://patreon.com/poorimpulse\">patreon/poorimpulse</a> or to make a one time donation, visit <a href=\"http://cash.me/$stainless\">cash.me/$stainless</a></p>"
