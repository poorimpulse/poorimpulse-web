          a(href='http://poorimpulse.co/') Poor Impulse Control
          |  is a podcast generated by playing games
          | of Fiasco with friends and family. I
          | started this podcast as an excuse to
          | learn audio editing, narration, and short
          | story writing.
          | It's a continual learning process, and I appreciate
          | you joining me on this journey.  Some episodes
          | will be rough, especially at the beginning as I
          | learn all the tricks of recording and editing audio,
          | so bear with me.
        p
          | And, of course, if you are interested in playing Fiasco for
          | the podcast, or narrating an episode, visit&nbsp;
          a(href='http://poorimpulse.co/about') poorimpulse.co/about

        p Thanks, and enjoy the ride.
