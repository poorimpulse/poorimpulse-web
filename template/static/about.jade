    p
      | Poor Impulse Control is a series of audiobook-format episodes that are
      | stories generated by playing games of&nbsp;
      a(href='http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/') Fiasco
      | &nbsp;with friends.  After playing the game, we write a story based
      | on the story that developed from the games.

    p
      | Narration is rotated between a number of voice actors to keep things
      | fresh, and we are always accepting new voice actors on a volunteer
      | basis.

      | The podcast is produced by&nbsp;
      +person('rhay')
      | &nbsp;and is made with pride in Seattle, WA
